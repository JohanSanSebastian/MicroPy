# MicroPy
MicroPy is an automatic microphone controller made using python. It listens to your microphone using the sound-device library and respectively mutes and unmutes you.

## What it does
It automatically mutes you if you are not speaking and unmutes you if you are during meetings.
 
## How we built it
MicroPy was built using the sound-device library of python. And also uses autohotkey for microphone controls.

## Challenges we ran into
A perfect library that could both track dB level from the microphone and be easy to use as I am a beginner.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
To be able to see a working project

## What we learned
A lot on sound detection and automation.

## What's next for MicroPy
The ability to control what platform you are on (zoom, teams etc.) from the GUI.
